                <p>Coffee Place offers a unique coffee house environment unlike any other in Macon. We are not only a
                    place to drop in and get your morning cup of coffee (although you are more than welcome to do that),
                    we are a place where you can sit down and enjoy that tailor-made cup of coffee. If you need to work,
                    we have a seating area created specifically for you. If you need to rest, we have a soft-seating
                    area in front of a stone fire place that is perfect for your weary mind and body. We offer a
                    delicious variety of coffee from Safehouse Coffee made by our professionally trained baristas. We
                    have everything from classic coffee to our house made specialty beverages. All of our sauces &
                    syrups are made in-house with all natural ingredients (no chemicals or preservatives) ensuring you
                    the highest quality in taste & health. You can complete your coffee with one of our delicious sweet
                    treats made by our very own baker. We look forward to serving you at Coffee Place!</p>
